# Space Shooter
This is the first video game I ever finished.  
I made it when I was 12.  
  
The game is not very good.  
The code is REALLY not good.  
However, it is here as a lesson. A reminder of what I used to be. *shivers*  
  
I needed to go through and do some fixing up in order for it to build properly, but the code is as close to original as possible.  
The only things I changed are:
  * Loading images properly when they're packaged.
  * Fixed transparency in images.
  * Fixed a bug to do with collision with space rocks.
  * Fixed a bug to do with key presses often not registering.
  * Removed unused code.
  
 
If for some reason you'd like to download and play the game, look in the "build" folder.
